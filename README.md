# Aos-Toxxer / Mass Reporter Tool
This is a tox tool I made, download the requests module and insert the tokens in tokens.txt

The report will ONLY work if the accounts are in the guild.
The reasons can has to be numbers from 1 to 5, I recommend using "1"

0: {reason: 0, label: "Illegal Content",…}
1: {reason: 1, label: "Harassment",…}
2: {reason: 2, label: "Spam or Phishing Links",…}
3: {reason: 3, label: "Self Harm", description: "Person is at risk of claimed intent of self-harm."}
4: {reason: 4, label: "NSFW Content",…}
